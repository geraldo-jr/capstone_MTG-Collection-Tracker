# capstone_MTG-Collection-Tracker
# Description: 
This project is a basic webapp product that helps MTG players catalog and organize their Magic the gathering collections. It was built on an mobile friendly, intuitive interface that displays usefull information about the cards in the collection and also separated by card type. The software uses the official [magicthegathering.io](https://magicthegathering.io/) API to search and get all the cards information. Although magicthegathering.io is not an official API, it's constantly updated with the latest cards launched. 

# Members 
This group is composed by Geraldo Pereira Junior, AJ Fischer, and Zeke Arthur Huebler.

# Technology
The tech stack used for this project is mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js for backend, and Postgres for database. We will also be using Heroku services to host our webapp with magicthegathering.io as our API via Javascript SDK to fetch the updated MTG cards information.
